# AI-chatbot-to-query-documents
How it Works?
The Front-end has been created using Streamlit which is a Python framework and the App is Hosted on Streamlit cloud, the App is able to take any document and questions as input from the User, after which it passes it to the gpt-3.5-turbo model as a query which then parses through the pdf to provide an answer to the user's question, the use of more improved models such as gpt-4o, gives better output, However since this project is only for our learning purpose we have used gpt-3.5-turbo

**DISCLAIMER**: This app is created solely for educational and testing purposes,hence the API key has been removed and when the website calls the API and an error message is displayed. Kindly note that it is not available for general use, as accessing the OpenAI API requires purchasing tokens directly from OpenAI.
