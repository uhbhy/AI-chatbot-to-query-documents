# AI-chatbot-to-query-documents
DocQuery is a powerful app that allows you to upload various document types such as TXT, DOCX, and PDF files, and ask questions about the content. Our app leverages advanced language models to provide accurate and insightful answers based on the uploaded documents.

How it Works?
The Front-end has been created using Streamlit which is a Python framework and the App is Hosted on Streamlit cloud, the App is able to take any document and questions as input from the User, after which it passes it to the gpt-3.5-turbo model as a query which then parses through the pdf to provide an answer to the user's question, the use of more improved models such as gpt-4o, gives better output, However since this project is only for our learning purpose we have used gpt-3.5-turbo

**DISCLAIMER**: This App is was created only for educational and testing purposes, it is not available for use to everyone as calling the OpenAI API requires tokens to be purchased from OpenAI.
